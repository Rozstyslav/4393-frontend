    <h3>How Craft Beer Differs From Regular Beer</h3>
    <p>
      Craft beer is produced in limited quantities, as opposed to factory beer.
      Old recipes are taken as a basis and are transformed into something
      original, relevant, and always stylish. In the process of brewing craft
      beer, the main focus is on taste and ingredients. Each bottle should be
      perfect, and the product should not be like everyone else's.

    <h3>What Main Ingredients Are There in Craft Beer?</h3>
    <p>
      There are four main ingredients used in beer production: water, barley
      malt, hops, and yeast. Water makes up 95% of beer. The water used in
      brewing must be of high quality. The taste of beer depends on the quality
      of the water. Hops give the beer its characteristic bitterness and a
      pleasant aroma. Hops have a unique and extremely complex chemical
      composition, so this ingredient cannot be replaced by any other substances
      without changing the quality and properties of the beer.

    <h3>Which Beer to Choose for a Party With Friends?</h3>
    <p>
      Some people like light lager beer, while others prefer saturated imperial
      stout. When preparing for a party, there are two options: buy each guest's
      favorite beers or choose neutral styles.
